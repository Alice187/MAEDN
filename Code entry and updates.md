Mensch Ärger Dich Nicht Python Game


First entry (12.07.2021, 18:00)

This is the traditional german board game Mensch Ärger Dich Nicht (translated: Man Don't Get Mad). I'm using the pygame library for this (pip install pygame)
and have been doing this for like 20 hours in total now, since I'm a beginner. But this code doesn't work as it's supposed to. All the parts should work in
theory, since I have tested them each in a test file. When I start the code, what it does is to crash (Not responding windows error). You probably dont have
to care about the german words...
